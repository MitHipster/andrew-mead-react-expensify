## Description

Re-created a React-based expense tracking app using React v16, Redux, Webpack v3, Babel, React-Router v4, and Firebase as the key technologies. This app is deployed on Heroku using Node and Express server.

### Prerequisites

Install Node using [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/). This will also install npm for package management.

```
brew install node
```

### Installing

After downloading or cloning the repo perform the following steps:

Open the project folder at the root in the terminal and run `npm install` to download the dependencies needed for this project.

Next, type `npm run dev-server` to run the source version of the application locally on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/). You can also build a production version of the app using `npm run build:prod` and serve it locally using Node and Express by running `npm start` and navigating to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
